# Monster-Wiki-Bot
A discord bot for D&D monsters. This bot attempts to simplify research on monsters while keeping the game un-spoiled for people who aren't DMs.

Specific stats will be withheld from anyone who isn't an admin on the discord server or doesn't know the code for the website.

Contact me to get such code. Except don't really right now cause it's not implemented yet lol.

# Running the bot
Just do `python bot.js`
